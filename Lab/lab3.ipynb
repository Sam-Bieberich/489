    "When the NMOS switch M1 is ON (Vsw = 1), the sampling circuit behaves as a series RC circuit and the input Vin is sampled on the capacitor. When the switch turns OFF (Vsw = 0), the voltage on the capacitor is held constant until the beginning of the next sampling phase. If the ON resistance of the switch is R, then the time constant of the sampler, Ï„, is R*C.  \n",
