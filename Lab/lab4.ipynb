    "Assume that an ADC uses an oversampling factor \\(K = \\frac{f_s}{2B}\\), where \\(f_s\\) is the sampling rate and \\(B\\) is the signal bandwidth. Then \\(K = 1\\) is Nyquist rate and \\(K > 1\\) means oversampling. The quantization noise variance is \\(\\sigma_e^2 = \\frac{\\Delta^2}{12}\\) as we defined in class for the additive noise model. As you may recall also, this noise is uniformly distributed and white, i.e., is flat in the frequency range \\([0, f_s/2]\\). Then the noise power spectral density will be \\(\\frac{\\sigma_e^2}{f_s}\\), so the integral in the range \\([-f_s/2, f_s/2]\\) is \\(\\sigma_e^2\\). Now assume that a perfect low-pass filter is used that selects the signal bandwidth \\(B\\) and rejects all the out of band noise. Find an expression for the output SNR of this oversampled ADC+low-pass filter combination."
